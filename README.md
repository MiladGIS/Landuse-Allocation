# Allocation of landuse in a sample area

## Introduction
This project looks into the compatibility and incompatibility between different land uses due to the positive and negative impacts that neighboring uses have on each other. Special criteria are considered for each use so that the placement of two uses next to each other is based on these criteria.

## Methodology
In this project, three main uses - agricultural, urban, and industrial - are considered. The allocation process for each will take place in rural areas with demand for these uses. To allocate a use, it is necessary to have a potential use map for each region. The potential use maps for each region have to be prepared using physical suitability, accessibility, neighborhood, and limitation. The physical suitability criterion considered in this project is slope, but this could include other criteria such as soil, elevation, slope direction, vegetation cover, and other environmental factors. For accessibility, two criteria - main and secondary roads - are used. Neighborhood is examined in terms of surrounding rings and a distance of 800 kilometers. A protected environmental area is also used as a limitation map.

## Demand Determination
After preparing the potential map, demand determination is carried out. In this project, the study area is divided into five rural areas with different use demands - agricultural, urban, and industrial. Finally, allocation will take place according to the mentioned criteria or some defined rules.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effectiveness of considering various factors such as physical suitability, accessibility, neighborhood, and limitation in land use planning. The comparison of different uses and the consideration of demand in different rural areas provide a comprehensive view of land use allocation. obtained result shown in below figure.
